# ArmA-GeoGuessr
A simple Geo Guesser for ArmA 3

Works for all maps.

change the .altis part to whatever map you would want to play.

for example:
- .tanoa
- .stratis
- .cherno

To play the mission you need to put it in your Missions folder. The path will look something like this:

C:\Users\%user%\Documents\Arma 3 - Other Profiles\%profile%\missions

NOTE: The folder you put in the missions folder will be named "GeoGuessr.altis"

Then, when in game press:

Multiplayer -> Server Browser -> Host Server -> Host Server -> Select the Altis map -> Press GeoGuessr.altis and... you're in.
